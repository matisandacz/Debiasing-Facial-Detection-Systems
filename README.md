# Debiasing-Facial-Detection-Systems
 
In this lab, we'll investigate one recently published approach to addressing algorithmic bias. We'll build a facial detection model that learns the latent variables underlying face image datasets and uses this to adaptively re-sample the training data, thus mitigating any biases that may be present in order to train a debiased model.

We will be implementing the following paper: http://introtodeeplearning.com/AAAI_MitigatingAlgorithmicBias.pdf
